## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React.js**  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **React Hooks**:  
  - `useState` → for managing input values  
  - `useRef` → for directly accessing DOM elements  
- **CSS** → basic styling & responsiveness  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Tasks are not saved — refreshing the page clears the list.  
- Uses direct DOM manipulation instead of React’s declarative state-driven rendering.  
- No advanced styling or animations.  
- No support for task categories, deadlines, or priorities.  
- Not optimized for large-scale usage.
